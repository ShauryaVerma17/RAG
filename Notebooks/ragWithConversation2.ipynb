Prepare the Printer:**\\n\\n* **Swap Cartridges:** Remove the black print cartridge and replace it with the photo cartridge. The manual states that you should store the black cartridge in an airtight container when not in use.\\n* **Align Cartridges:**  If this is a new cartridge, align them according to your printer\\'s instructions. Use plain paper for alignment to save your photo paper.\\n\\n**2. Load Photo Paper:**\\n\\n* Load the photo paper into the input tray, glossy-side down.\\n\\n**3. Print Settings (Windows):**\\n\\n* **Open Print Dialog:** In your software, go to \"File\" and select \"Print\".\\n* **Select Printer:** Ensure your HP Deskjet 2623 is chosen as the printer.\\n* **Properties/Settings:** Click the button that opens the Properties dialog box (it might be labeled differently depending on your software).\\n* **Paper Type:** In the \"Setup\" tab, select \"HP Photo Paper\" or \"HP Premium Photo Paper\".\\n* **Quality:** Choose the highest quality setting available (usually \"Maximum DPI\").\\n* **Photo Fix:**  Click the \"Color Options\" disclosure triangle and choose either \"Off\" (no changes) or \"On\" (auto-focus and sharpness adjustment). \\n\\n**4. Print:**\\n\\n* Click \"OK\" to close the Properties dialog box.\\n* Click \"Print\" to start printing your photo.\\n\\n**5. After Printing:**\\n\\n* **Remove Promptly:** Take each printed sheet out of the printer right away.\\n* **Dry Properly:** Allow the prints to dry glossy-side up in a low-humidity environment. Drying time varies.\\n\\n\\nLet me know if you have any more questions about printing!'"
