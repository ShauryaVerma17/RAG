      "\n",
      "2. **Tokenizing:** The browser converts strings of characters into distinct tokens, as specified by the W3C HTML5 standard (e.g., \"<html>\", \"<body>\", and other strings within the \"angle brackets\"). Each token has a special meaning and set of rules.\n",

      "User : What is a DNS lookup?\n",
      "Assistant : A DNS lookup is the process by which a computer translates a human-readable domain name into an IP address. Here are the steps involved in a DNS lookup:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **User Request:** When you enter a URL in your browser, your operating system sends a request to the DNS resolver (usually provided by your operating system or web browser) to resolve the domain name.\n",
      "2. **Root DNS Server:** The DNS resolver starts at the root DNS server, which is like a phonebook for the internet. It asks the root server what the authoritative DNS server is for the top-level domain (TLD) of the URL you entered (e.g., .com).\n",
      "3. **TLD DNS Server:** The root DNS server directs the DNS resolver to the TLD DNS server. In this case, it would be the .com DNS server.\n",
      "4. **Authoritative DNS Server:** The TLD DNS server tells the DNS resolver where to find the authoritative DNS server for the specific domain name (e.g., example.com).\n",
      "5. **Zone File Query:** The authoritative DNS server checks its zone file, which contains information about all the domains it is responsible for. It looks up the IP address associated with the domain name you entered.\n",
      "6. **Response:** The authoritative DNS server sends the IP address back to the DNS resolver, which then returns it to your operating system or web browser.\n",
      "7. **Cache Update:** Finally, the DNS resolver caches the response so that if someone else on the same network looks up the same domain name, they can retrieve the cached IP address instead of going through the entire process again.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is how a DNS lookup works!\n",
      "User : can you give me the ansewer to my last question as a paragraph?\n",
      "Assistant : Here is the answer to your previous question in a paragraph:\n",
      "\n",
      "A DNS lookup is the process by which a computer translates a human-readable domain name into an IP address. When you enter a URL in your browser, your operating system sends a request to the DNS resolver to resolve the domain name. The DNS resolver starts at the root DNS server, asking what the authoritative DNS server is for the top-level domain of the URL you entered. From there, it follows a series of steps to find the authoritative DNS server for the specific domain name and retrieve the associated IP address. This process involves checking zone files and caching responses so that subsequent lookups can be resolved more quickly.\n"
